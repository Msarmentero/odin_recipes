        <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. 
            Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>

            <p class="food-subtitle ">ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            
        </ul>

            <p class="food-subtitle ">Directions</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                    Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. 
                    Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.
                    Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
                    Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
            </ol>
