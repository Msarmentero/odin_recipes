            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Heat oil from sun-dried tomatoes in a large pot over medium-high until shimmering. 
                    Add sausage; cook, stirring occasionally, until sausage crumbles and is almost fully 
                    cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add onions and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, 
                    until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add tomato paste and sun-dried tomatoes;
                    cook, stirring constantly, until tomato paste is slightly 
                    deeper red in color and fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in broth, cream, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, 
                    and paprika; bring to a boil over medium, stirring occasionally,
                    until bubbling and frothy on top, about 12 minutes. 
                    Add pasta and reduce heat to medium-low; cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally,
                    until orzo is al dente, about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low, and add spinach, cream cheese, and Parmesan;
                    cook, stirring often, until cream cheese and spinach is wilted, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Garnish with additional Parmesan cheese and basil before serving.</li>
            </ol>
