        <h2>Sesame noodle salad</h2>

        <p>This amazing salad recipe was given to me by a friend
           who used to know someone at the now closed Larry's Markets in the Seattle area.
            I've added to the recipe a little -- so it's not exactly the same... 
            but better! I take this to every picnic and everyone loves it!
            May also add diced chicken for a variation.</p>

        <h4>ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
            <li>½ cup sesame oil</li>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot chili oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or more if desired</li>
            <li> green onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
            

            <h4>Directions</h4>
            
        </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.
                     Once the water is boiling, stir in the angel hair pasta, and return to a boil.
                      Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, 
                      but is still firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
                <li>Whisk together the sesame oil, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, chili oil, and sugar in a large bowl. 
                    Toss the pasta in the dressing, then sprinkle with sesame seeds, green onion, and bell pepper. 
                    Serve warm, or cover and refrigerate for a cold salad.</li>

            </ol>
